The offset was calculated by performing a bubbler test as described by the manufacturer (PME). Dissolved oxygen saturation was calculated using the Garcia & Gordon (1992) equation with miniDOT dissolved oxygen and baroTROLL absolute pressure. The absolute pressure data was interpolated using linear interpolation to account for difference in logging time intervals.

The offset was calculated by subtracting the pressure when it was removed from the pressure when it was redeployed. This resulted in the two data points being equal. Any visual sudden changes in pressure were assumed to be the sensor moving and were corrected in the same manor using an offset.
