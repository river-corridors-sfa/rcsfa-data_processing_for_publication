v3_readme_CM_SSS.pdf,Data package level readme. Contains data package summary; acknowledgements; and contact information.,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v3_CM_SSS_dd.csv,Data dictionary that defines columns headers across all csv files contained in the data package.,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,File-level metadata that lists and describes all of the files contained in the data package. Two copies of the flmd have been included in this data package: one outside of the data zip folder and one inside. The purpose of this duplicated file is for the user to see the data package contents without downloading and unzipping the data folder; while still maintaining a complete set of files inside the zip.,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
CM_Field_Protocol.pdf,"Step-by-step instructions used to complete the sampling in the field for data and sample names that have ""CM"" at the beginning.",v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,

v3_CM_SSS_Field_Metadata.csv,Metadata for each set of samples collected at a given point in space and time. Each row generally refers to a set of many vials collected for different analysis and often includes three replicates per analysis collected together that are each named with the same sample name and each have a replicate identifier appended to the end to create a unique identifier (e.g. CM_005 provides information for the samples CM_005_ICR-1; CM_005_ICR-2; CM_005_ICR-3; which were individual vials collected in the field at the same time and location and can be treated as biological replicates). The metadata file provides accompanying information captured in the field (i.e. coordinates; date; turbidity; water color; weather; etc.).,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v3_CM_SSS_Metadata_IGSN-Mapping.csv,File that maps between sample names and registered International Generic Sample Numbers (IGSNs). Includes metadata required by ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Sample ID and Metadata (Damerow et al. 2020). Some fields are repeated from the field metadata. In compliance with the ESS-DIVE Location Metadata Reporting Format (Crystal-Ornelas et al. 2022) the Submission_Contact_Name; Submission_Contact_Email; Location_ID; Description; Latitude; and Longitude can all be found in the Dataset Metadata associated with this data package (and found on the ESS-DIVE landing page). The Location_ID; Latitude; and Longitude can also be found in v3_CM_SSS_IGSN-Mapping.csv as Locality; Latitude; and Longitude; respectively. There is no separate file associated with the ESS-DIVE Location Metadata Reporting Format.,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
CM_SSS_Sediment_Specific_Surface_Area.csv,Specific surface area data from sediment samples. This analysis was run on a subset of samples; more samples may be added in the future. Methods information is embedded with methods codes that are defined in v3_CM_SSS_Methods_Codes.csv. The file follows the ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil; Sediment; and Water Chemistry data (Boye et al. 2022).,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v2_CM_SSS_Sediment_Fe.csv,Iron (II) data from sediment samples. Methods information is embedded with methods codes that are defined in v3_CM_SSS_Methods_Codes.csv. The file follows the ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil; Sediment; and Water Chemistry data (Boye et al. 2022). Samples that were incubated with both 10 milliliters of sediment and 2.5 milliliters of sediment have three additional replicates (-4; -5; -6 in addition to -1; -2; -3). Each biological replicate also has analytical replicates (-1a; -1b; -1c).,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v2_CM_SSS_Sediment_Normalized_Respiration_Rates.csv,Mean respiration rates normalized to sediment volume in the incubation vials. Methods information is embedded with methods codes that are defined in v3_CM_SSS_Methods_Codes.csv. The file follows the ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil; Sediment; and Water Chemistry data (Boye et al. 2022). The calculation used to produce some of these data (theoretical respiration rates) includes assumptions that the project team has decided are appropriate; but the user should decide if using this data is appropriate for their analysis. See methods deviation codes for more detail.,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v2_CM_SSS_Sediment_Sample_Data_Summary.csv,"Mean iron (II); mean respiration; mean normalized respiration; specific surface area; and grain size from sediment samples. Methods information is embedded with methods codes that are defined in v3_CM_SSS_Methods_Codes.csv. The file follows the ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil; Sediment; and Water Chemistry data (Boye et al. 2022). For each sampling event (e.g. CM_005_Sediment); the Fe values of all biological and analytical replicates of 10 milliliter incubations ONLY (i.e. replicates -1; -2; and -3) are averaged. The respiration; normalized respiration; and  values of all biological replicates are averaged per sampling event. The grain size data is not averaged because there is only one rep per sampling event; therefore CM_005_Sediment is the same as CM_005_GRN. The ""Mean_Missing_Reps"" column indicates if a mean does not include all replicates using a TRUE/FALSE flag where TRUE indicates one or more replicates are missing from the mean.  This file was previously called ""CM_SSS_Sediment_Normalized_Respiration_Rates_Summary.csv"". Specific surface area was run on a subset of sampling events (i.e. Parent ID). Specific surface area data from additional sampling events (i.e. Parent_IDs) may be added in the future.",v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,

Samples that were incubated with both 10 milliliters of sediment and 2.5 milliliters of sediment have three additional replicates (-4; -5; -6 in addition to -1; -2; -3).,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,

v3_CM_SSS_Sediment_Incubations_Respiration_Rates.csv,Respiration rates calculated from time series dissolved oxygen data measured from laboratory incubations of sediment. This data is used by the machine learning model. Methods information is embedded with methods codes that are defined in v3_CM_SSS_Methods_Codes.csv. The file follows the ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for Soil; Sediment; and Water Chemistry data (Boye et al. 2022). Samples where data from the 2.5 milliliters of sediment was used have reps 4; 5; and 6 instead of 1; 2; and 3. Reps 1; 2; and 3 were used for the 10 milliliter incubation and that data was not used. The calculation used to produce some of these data (theoretical respiration rates) includes assumptions that the project team has decided are appropriate; but the user should decide if using this data is appropriate for their analysis. See methods deviation codes for more detail.,v3_CM_SSS_flmd.csv,
v3_CM_SSS_Water_NPOC_TN.csv,Dissolved organic carbon (DOC; reported as non-purgeable organic carbon; NPOC) and total nitrogen (TN) from water samples.

v3_CM_SSS_Water_Sample_Data_Summary.csv,"Mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC; measured as non-purgeable organic carbon; NPOC) and total nitrogen from water samples. For each sampling event (e.g. CM_005_OCN) the NPOC values of each of the three biological replicates (e.g. CM_005_OCN-1; CM_005_OCN-2; CM_005_OCN-3) are averaged. Any replicate values that were an outlier (using distance-based outlier detection) or above/below the limit of detection are not included in the mean. The ""Mean_Missing_Reps"" column indicates if a mean does not include all three replicates using a TRUE/FALSE flag where TRUE indicates one or more replicates are missing from the mean. Methods information is embedded with methods codes that are defined in v3_CM_SSS_Methods_Codes.csv.
