ISO_T_AN_001,"Isotopic measurements of hydrogen (?2H) and oxygen (?18O) in water were conducted at the Oregon State Stable Isotope Collaboratory (OSSIC) using a Picarro L2130-i isotopic water analyzer through near-infrared cavity ringdown spectroscopy. Daily runs utilize three working standards, annually calibrated to international reference materials to ensure accuracy. An extra standard, closely matching the sample matrix, verifies calibration.",Picarro L2130-i isotopic water analyzer,method_id_analysis,Oregon State University,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
ISO_T_DP_001,"Quality Objectives: ?2H-Accuracy: ± 0.50 ‰, Precision: 0.30 ‰ ?18O- Accuracy: ± 0.07 ‰, Precision- 0.04 ‰. Precision, the closeness of repeated measures, is usually expressed as the standard deviation. The overall precision for isotopic analysis is calculated using the standard deviation of the working standards and an independent QC standard. Overall precision should not exceed 0.3 per mil for ?2H or 0.2 per mil for ?18O. Accuracy assesses the difference between a measured value and the true value, estimated by comparing calibrated standards against Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) from organizations like NIST. Bias, a systematic error, can affect accuracy. Each run includes four calibrated standards: three for calibration curves and one as a QC sample. Accuracy is acceptable if the QC sample agrees with the standard value within ±0.5 per mil for ?2H and ±0.07 per mil for ?18O. Primary standards for ?2H and ?18O include V-SMOW, SLAP, and GISP, ensuring global laboratory comparability. Frequent inter-lab reference material exchanges are conducted for comparison.",N/A,method_id_dataprocessing,Oregon State University,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

NPOC_T_005,"Vials were intact and filled to marked line. No precipitate or suspended particles. 2 microliters of 85% phosphoric acid per 5 milliliters of sample was put in vial prior to adding sample. Stored at -20 degC then thawed in 4 degC for three days. 5 milliliters sample pipetted into analysis vial. Best 4 of 5 injections; injection volume: 150 microliters; furnace temperature: 720 degC; standard concentration ranges 0.3-20 milligrams_per_liter_carbon. Data evaluated for whether values were within +/- 10% of standard curve. If not then values were replaced with ""Below_Range"" or ""Above_Range"" text. Standard curves must have R-squared values >0.985. If standard curve R-squared is <0.985 then sample values are replaced with ""Low_Rsq_in_STD_Curve"". Injections with Area of 0 were dropped. If any sample had fewer than 3 injections then sample values are replaced with ""Too_Few_Injections"". If there were more than 3 injections - the 3 that were closest to each other were retained; the others were dropped. For each sample - the ratio of maximum to minimum areas within the remaining 3 injections was found and if the ratio was greater than 2 - the reported concentration is given as ""Injections_Too_Variable.""",Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon L series (TOC-L),method_id,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL),N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Water_Column_01,Sensor (YSI EcoSense ODO200M) is either 1) placed on the riverbed as close to the thalweg as possible (typically used for wadeable rivers) or 2) deployed from the river bank approximately 2 to 3 feet below the water surface (typically used for non-wadeable rivers). The installation method used at the time of deployment is dependent upon river depth and access to the shoreline. No continuous data are collected. Meter readings are manually recorded on the field metadata sheet. Sensor barometric pressure and dissolved oxygen are calibrated in the laboratory the day prior to sampling using real-time daily meteorological data collected at Hanford Meteorological Station# 11 (300A) located 405 feet above mean sea level (MSL). Raw dissolved oxygen (milligrams per liter (mg/L)) measurements are automatically corrected for temperature and pressure under ambient conditions.,YSI EcoSense ODO200M,method_id,N/A,M01,Columbia River, fresh water river [ENVO:01000297],Surface of sediment or soil; Open water column
