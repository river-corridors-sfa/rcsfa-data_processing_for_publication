The SSS Data Package was versioned using a combination of manual edits (in which I opened the csv, changed the value, and resaved the document) and via these scripts. 

The scripts `SSS_Data_Package_v2_RenameSiteIDs.R`, `SSS_Data_Package_v2_UpdateCoordinates.R`, and `SSS_Data_Package_v2_UpdateIGSNDOIs.R` used the helper functions. 

Complete details of the version changes can be located in the published SSS Data Package version 2.
