# rcsfa-data_proceesing_for_publication  
This repository hosts the scripts and documentation for preparing RC-SFA data packages.

| Data_Package_Documentation          | These scripts format data and create metadata for data packages, promoting consistent language use across data packages. This includes Boye, Goldman, FLMD, and DD formatting.           |

| Data_Package_ESS-DIVE               | These scripts are used to interact with ESS-DIVE's landing pages, including creating, updating, and accessing landing page information and data.                                         |
| Data_Package_Validation             | These scripts perform checks on data. They generally take an input and return a report that summarizes the input.                                                                        |
| Data_Tranformation                  | These scripts perform actions that manipulate the existing data into various formats. These are formatting scripts that can be easily used beyond the context of creating data packages. |
| Study_Data_Package_Specific_Scripts | These are stand alone scripts that were used to process and format study data packages. They are preserved for traceability and documentation more so than for continued use.            |
